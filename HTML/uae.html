Theodosius and Valentinian made further repairs to the Colosseum, most likely as a result of a serious earthquake in 443. As the Colosseum continued to age, more construction was required in 464 and 508. After then, the amphitheater went unused for public spectacles. By 1362, the outer south side of the Colosseum had collapsed, likely the cause of an earthquake in 1349.

"The substructure of the arena was partly excavated from 1810-1814 and 1847, with archeologist Pietro Rosa uncovering the complete depth of the substructure. Flooding took its toll again, filling the site with water, which took years to remove."
